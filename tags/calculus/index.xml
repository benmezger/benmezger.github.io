Why Integral Calculus # Figure 1 represents 2 graphs of y = cos(x). Let&amp;rsquo;s say we would like to calculate the area of \( x\_1 \) . We could calculate the area by aproximation, for example, Graph B is filled with the area we would like to calculate, so we could divide this area by equal sections of \(\Delta x_n\) from a to b rectangles, then we could calculate the area of these rectangles by \(f(x_i) * \Delta x_n\) where \(f\) is the area of each of the rectangles.</description></item></channel></rss>
