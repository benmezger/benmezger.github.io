Check the project’s README. The place I work at requires Jira story ID and task ID attached to the commit body. Initially, I was attaching the ID to the commit body manually, by checking either my previous commit or opening up the Jira board, however, after working some hours I was easily forgetting to attach the IDs to the commit and getting annoying having to either reword them and perhaps having to lookup Jira again.</description></item><item><title>Finding exposed .git repositories</title><link>https://seds.nl/posts/finding-exposed-git-repositories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2017 21:59:00 -0200</pubDate><guid>https://seds.nl/posts/finding-exposed-git-repositories/</guid><description>Developers use git to version control their source code. We all do, in fact, this blog is currently versioned by git. However, we not only use git to version control, but also to deploy applications. Usually we push new code to a remote server, where the server takes care of testing the code and then deploying the application. There are different ways of deploying an application, but this is one of them.</description></item></channel></rss>
