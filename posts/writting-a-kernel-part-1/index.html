small, portable kernel for the RISC-V architecture. I developed a
micro-kernel for the RISC-V ISA in my bachelor thesis, however, due to
the time it takes on developing a kernel, and the time I had on writing
a bachelor&rsquo;s thesis, I choose on writing the kernel for the <a href=https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive1-rev-b>Sifive&rsquo;s
HiFive1 Rev B</a> development
board due to their well written bare metal compatibility
<a href=https://github.com/sifive/freedom-metal>Library</a> for the board, low
cost and most importantly, RISC-V.</p><p>By using Sifive&rsquo;s API, it took out the overhead of having to deal with
the configurations of the clock, interrupt, CPU, and generally required
hardware for the kernel to run. Long story short, I submitted my thesis,
got approved, and now I am willing to rewrite the code all over. During
the development of my thesis, there were components I needed to write
and have a better understanding, so I was not able to pay as much
attention as I wanted to the project design, structural decisions, and
general kernel/architectural decisions. One of the decisions I made
during the development phase was not to document my ideas, questions,
and answers I had. This post attempts to fix this problem, by
documenting on how to write a Kernel for the RISC-V architecture.</p><p>Before we start, let&rsquo;s remember some basic computer concepts and try to
assemble them together so we can better understand how each component
fits within a kernel.</p><h2 id=a-modern-computer>A modern computer</h2><p>A modern computer consists of at least one central processing unit, main
memory, some data storage, and another type of input and output devices.
Computer architecture is the specification on which describes how
software and hardware may interact with each other. Computer processors
provide an abstract model interface known as the instruction set, which
serves as an interface between the hardware and software.</p><h2 id=the-need-for-a-kernel>The need for a kernel</h2><p>Application developers need to communicate with these types of hardware,
and by having to learn each computer specification is difficult and
time-consuming. The kernel is the middle section of the abstraction
between hardware and user software (Figure <a href=#org6623b5b>1</a>). It manages
computer resources to allow application programmers to communicate with
them.</p><p>By having a simpler model of the computer, application programmers can
write less error-prone software by leaving the hardware complexity to
the kernel.</p><p><a id=org6623b5b></a></p><figure><img src=/assets/imgs/os-hw-flow.png></figure><p>Kernels may provide little to no abstraction at all. Kernels may be
necessary for specific purposes instead of offering any resource to an
upper layer. We can take the traffic light system as an example. The
system may need to change states every 60 seconds, and that is all. For
that, instead of having a Kernel, we could do some simple bare-metal
programming, enable a timer interrupt and have a timer interrupt handler
handle state changes<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.</p><h2 id=the-computer-organization-and-architecture>The computer organization and architecture</h2><p>Although there are different distinctions made between computer
architecture and organization, the first refers to what systems and
application programmers see, which are the attributes that have a direct
impact on the execution of a program, for example, whether a computer
will have a multiply instruction, where the latter refers to the
operational unit and its interconnections that make the architectural
specifications, such as whether the multiply instruction will be
implemented by a multiply unit or by a mechanism of repeated add unit.
The ISA, the numbers of bits used to represent data types, the IO
structure, and approaches for memory addressing are all organizational
issues that need to be structured (Stallings 2011).</p><p>The computer organization creates a hierarchy of hardware attributes
details that are transparent to the programmer, such the interface
between the computer and peripherals, the memory technology used, the
type of processor and control signals (Stallings 2011). Computer
architecture should offer a clean abstract set to simplify design,
modeling, and allow running software to communicate with the hardware
available (Patterson and Hennessy 2017).</p><p>The processor needs extra hardware in order to do its job, RAM to store
program and data, support for logic and at least one I/O device to
transfer data between the computer and the outside world (Catsoulis
2005)</p><p>There is numerous computer architecture available, and the most common
one is Intel&rsquo;s x86, which is based on the Von Neumann architecture. Von
Neumann architecture suggests that data and instructions should be
stored together in memory. Programs should be fetched from memory for
execution by the CPU, where both data and programs are stored in memory
the same way. With that said, there is no physical separation between
data and program in modern CPUs. A Von Neumann microprocessor follows
the corresponding pattern:</p><ol><li><strong>Fetch</strong>: fetch the instruction and necessary data from memory.</li><li><strong>Decode</strong>: the instruction and data are separated, and the
components and pathways required to execute the instructions are
activated.</li><li><strong>Execute</strong>: the instruction is executed, the data is manipulate and
the results are stored back in memory.</li></ol><figure><img src=/assets/imgs/computer-architeture-pipeline.png alt="Figure 1: Von Neumann architecture"><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Von Neumann architecture</p></figcaption></figure><p>Other than Von Neumann&rsquo;s architecture, there is Harvard&rsquo;s architecture,
which the computer system memory is separated into two discrete parts:
data and instructions. In pure architecture, the two different memories
use separate memory modules, and instructions can only be executed from
the instruction memory.</p><p>While modern computers are based on Von Neumann&rsquo;s architecture, there
are newer variants that have features that are Harvard-like. While all
program instructions and data are stored in the same memory area.
However, by using a feature called paging, it allows physical memory to
be segmented into large blocks of memory called pages, and each page of
memory can either be an instruction or data.</p><p>Processors should be designed to <em>process</em>, <em>store</em> and <em>retrieve</em> data,
but for that to happen, the processor has to go through several stages,
where (i) fetch the instruction from memory, which could be the
register, cache or main memory, (ii) decode the instruction to figure
out what action is required to run, (iii) fetch data from memory or a IO
module if required, (iv) perform arithmetic or logical operation on the
fetched data if required and (v) the results of an execution may require
to be written back to memory or the IO module (Stallings 2011).</p><h2 id=final-conclusions>Final conclusions</h2><p>We understood a modern computer is a complex set of hardware with
different factors and use-cases. We saw how a kernel should interact
with the hardware and how it should abstract the underlying hardware
resources and provide some sort of API for programmers and users to
interact. Not all problems are solvable with a kernel, some times pure
bare-metal programming is what it takes to solve the problem, however,
when we are willing to multitask, exchange communication between
different resources, a Kernel might come in handy dealing with those
problems.</p><p>Computer organization is hierarchy of hardware attribute details that
are transparent to the programmer, like IO functions, inter-process
communication, memory management and etc.</p><p>I hope with this post you were able to understand or remember key
concepts of fundamental &ldquo;modern&rdquo; computing. Part 2 we will start
implementing the initial boot of our kernel, starting by initializing
the CPU and booting into QEMU&rsquo;s RISC-V emulator and as we go along, I
will introduce more concepts like those introduced in this post.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><div id=refs class="references hanging-indent"><div></div><div id=ref-Catsoulis:2005:DEH:1204014><div></div><p>Catsoulis, John. 2005. <em>Designing Embedded Hardware</em>. O&rsquo;Reilly Media,
